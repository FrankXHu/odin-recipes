    <h2>Garlic Mushrooms</h2>
    <p>These garlic mushrooms are easy to make by sautéing sliced mushrooms in butter with red wine. Delicious with grilled steaks or on top of toasted bread for a tasty appetizer.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds sliced fresh mushrooms</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms are a light golden brown and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, and pour wine into the skillet. Simmer until wine has mostly evaporated. Serve immediately.</li>
